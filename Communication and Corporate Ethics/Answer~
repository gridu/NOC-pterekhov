questions: 
	
	1) You have a recent request task that you are working with.
	   Meanwhile, you receive two critical tasks and one blocker.
           How will you respond to each ticket?

	2) Thereâ€™s an infrastructural problem:
	   GitLab is not working.
	   What will you do if the problem fixes right away; if it doesn't fix right away?


answers:

	1) First of all, i'll answer to the request 
	   (Good morning/evening, Mr <Surname>. We are working on your project, don't worry i'll do my best to solve any
           problems.)
           Then i'll fix the blocker and continue to work on each of critical tasks. 
	
	2) If the problem fixes right away: I'll thank my colleagues for fixing this problem and continue to work on my tasks.
           If the problem doesn't fix right away: I'll ask my colleagues about this problem and help them to fix this problem if they need my help,
           and then i'll continue to work on my tasks.
