Here you can see a dockerfile and a folder with 3 scripts

jenksetup.sh - downloads a jenkins.war from official site http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.121.2/jenkins.war
	       and launch jenkins.

jenkplugin.sh - downloads a jenkins-cli.jar, then uses it to download a job-dsl plugin and safe-restart jenkins

start.sh - runs these 2 scripts sequentially 

to build an image you should use sudo docker build cont/jenk . 
to run an image you should use sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -t cont/jenk
